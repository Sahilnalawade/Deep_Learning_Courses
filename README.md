# `AI for Medicine Specialization`

- Course 1, I have created convolutional neural network image classification and segmentation models to make diagnoses of lung and brain disorders. 
- Course 2, I have build risk models and survival estimators for heart disease using statistical methods and a random forest predictor to determine patient prognosis. 
- Course 3, I have build a treatment effect predictor, apply model interpretation techniques and use natural language processing to extract information from radiology reports.

# `Deep Learning Specialization`

• Build and train deep neural networks, implement vectorized neural networks, identify key parameters in architecture, and apply deep learning to your applications

• Use the best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building DL applications, use standard neural network techniques, apply optimization algorithms, and implement a neural network in TensorFlow

• Diagnose and use strategies for reducing errors in ML systems, understand complex ML settings, and apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning

• Build a CNN, apply it to visual detection and recognition tasks, use neural style transfer to generate art, and apply these algorithms to image, video, and other 2D/3D data

• Build and train RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs, apply RNNs to character-level language modeling, work with NLP and Word Embeddings, and use HuggingFace tokenizers and transformers to perform NER and Question Answering
